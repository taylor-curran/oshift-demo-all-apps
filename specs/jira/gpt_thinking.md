Below is a field-tested pattern you can adapt straight into Jira. It keeps the board understandable for executives while giving your engineering team the fidelity they need to execute and report progress.

## 1. Board & Workflow Design

| # | Recommendation | Why it Works | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.1** | **Single Kanban board** in one Jira project called “CF-to-OCP Migration Demo” | You avoid context-switching between boards and keep metrics (cycle time, WIP) in one place. | Give demo stakeholders *Viewer* rights; restrict editing to the migration squad. |
| **1.2** | **Seven-status workflow (column = status)**  
`Backlog → Ready → Analysis → Build/Design → Validate → Ready for Deploy → Deployed/Done` | - Mirrors real gates the audience expects (analysis, build, validate).  
- Keeps WIP visible without being noisy. | Use a **Done** resolution on the final status so velocity / throughput charts work. |
| **1.3** | **Statuses are *shared* across all app types** – avoid separate columns for Korifi vs Traditional CF | Platform differences are a *property* of the work, not a process phase. | Put platform info on the ticket (component/label) – see §2. |

**Why not the 4-column “To Do → In Progress → Testing → Done”?**  
A demo about *migration workflows* should show *how* you get from discovery to production. The simple four-step flow hides that critical story.

## 2. Surfacing Platform Differences (Korifi vs Traditional CF)

| Mechanism | How to Configure | How you’ll use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Components** | Create two: **Korifi** and **Traditional CF** | Quick board filters (“show only Korifi items”), component lead reports, cumulative flow by component. |
| **Labels** | Optional: add finer tags such as `needs-dockerfile`, `container-ready` | Lets you slice data without adding more components. |
| **Custom field (select list) “Platform Type”** | For larger orgs where Components already mean something else | Gives consistent reporting in dashboards. |

> **Avoid** separate swim-lanes or columns per platform: it splits WIP and hides true throughput.

---

## 3. Issue Hierarchy & Ticket Breakdown

| Jira type | Scope | Example for *Account Service* | Rule of Thumb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Epic** | One application **or** one cross-cutting work-stream (CI/CD setup, cluster prep) | **Epic:** `APP-ACCT – Account Service Migration` | 10 app-level epics + 1-2 infrastructure epics keep the roadmap tidy. |
| **Story / Task** | One lifecycle phase that delivers demonstrable value | `ACCT-01 Assess CF manifest`<br>`ACCT-02 Containerize (Dockerfile)`<br>`ACCT-03 Generate K8s manifests`<br>`ACCT-04 Validate against policies`<br>`ACCT-05 Functional test on Kind`<br>`ACCT-06 Demo deploy on Kind` | 5-6 stories for **Traditional CF** apps, 4-5 for **Korifi** apps. |
| **Sub-task** | Optional finer granularity (< 1 day effort) | Under `ACCT-02`: `Write Dockerfile`, `Create GH action`, `Push image` | Use only when multiple engineers touch the same story concurrently. |
| **Spike** | Time-boxed research (esp. legacy) | `LEG-00 Spike: mainframe adapter protocol mapping` | Limit to 2-5 days and assign Story Points so velocity doesn’t dip. |

### Ticket Count Sanity Check

| App Category | Apps | Avg. Stories/App | Total Stories |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Korifi** (container-ready) | 5 | ~4 | **≈ 20** |
| **Traditional CF** (needs containerization) | 5 | ~6 | **≈ 30** |
| **Infra/Enablers** (cluster setup, CI/CD) | — | — | **≈ 5** |
| **Total** | — | — | **≈ 55** (matches your proposal) |

---

## 4. Representing Complexity

| What to Capture | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Story Points** | Fibonacci or Power-of-2 scale; let the team point each story. |
| **Complexity label** | `complexity:high`, `complexity:low` – quick visual on the board. |
| **Extra design steps** | For *Very High* apps create a **Spike** + **Design** story before build. |
| **Risk field** (optional) | Add a custom “Risk” drop-down to help execs see hotspots. |

> *Legacy Mainframe Adapter*: create an **Epic** with a **Spike** first, then break out containerization & adapter testing stories.

---

## 5. Dependencies & Ordering

1.  **Issue links** – use “*blocks / is blocked by*” between stories across epics.
    
    -   Ex: `PAY-04 Validate manifests` **is blocked by** `ACCT-03 Generate manifests`.
        
2.  **Advanced Roadmaps (Jira Premium)**
    
    -   Show epic-level dependencies on a timeline for exec reporting.
        
3.  **Release / Fix Version**
    
    -   Group stories that must land in the same demo sprint (e.g., "Demo Day v0.1").
        
4.  **Automation Rule**
    
    -   When a blocking issue moves to **Ready for Deploy**, notify the blocked one’s assignee to pull next.

## Putting It All Together – Example Workflow for *Transaction Processor* (Traditional CF)

| Status | Issue Key | Summary | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Backlog** | TP-01 | Assess CF manifest & service bindings | Component = Traditional CF |
| **Analysis** | TP-02 (Spike) | Evaluate containerization strategy | Story Points = 3 |
| **Build/Design** | TP-03 | Write Dockerfile & CI pipeline | Linked to Kaniko image registry task |
| **Validate** | TP-04 | Policy check via Windsurf | Runs OPA & security scans |
| **Ready for Deploy** | TP-05 | Functional test on Kind | Blocks TP-06 |
| **Deployed/Done** | TP-06 | Demo deploy & sign-off | Fix Version = Demo v0.1 |

### Quick Answers to Your Specific Questions

| # | Question | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Workflow granularity** | Use the 7-status flow above. Too simple hides value; too granular stalls WIP. |
| **2** | **Platform differences** | Components or a custom field – *not* separate columns. |
| **3** | **Ticket breakdown** | Epic per app, 4-6 stories each (see §3). Cross-cutting infra epics for CI/CD and cluster bootstrap. |
| **4** | **Handling complexity** | Story Points + “Spike” tasks for unknowns; add a Design story for “High/Very High”. |
| **5** | **Dependencies & order** | Use “blocks” links + Roadmaps; group synchronous go-live items with a Fix Version. |

### Final Tips for a Polished Demo

1.  **Swim-lanes by Epic** – visually group each application on the Kanban board for exec walk-throughs.
    
2.  **Mark demo artifacts clearly** – prepend ticket summaries with 🎭 or `[DEMO]` so nobody confuses them with real delivery work.
    
3.  **Dashboards** – build a simple gadget set (Cumulative Flow, Two-Dimensional Filter by Component vs Status, Burndown by Fix Version) to reinforce that your migration tooling generates measurable progress.
    

Adopting the structure above will let you **showcase migration insights**, **manage risk**, and **prove repeatability**—all within a Jira board that your audience can grasp at a glance.
