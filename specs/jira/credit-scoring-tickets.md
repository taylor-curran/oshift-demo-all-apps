# Credit Scoring Engine â€“ Migration Ticket List

The following seven Jira tickets represent discrete working sessions needed to migrate the **Credit Scoring Engine** from Cloud Foundry to OpenShift.  Each ticket must deliver a short Markdown report placed under `small_apps/credit-scoring-engine/agent_specs/` to be considered *Done*.

## Inventory CF Artifacts for App credit-scoring-engine

- Analyse the cloudfoundry `manifest.yml`, env vars, and bound services.
- Identify all external dependencies (Postgres primary/replica, Redis cluster, S3 model store, Kafka audit trail).
- **Verification**: Cross-check service bindings with code; document whether each dependency is used, unused, or missing.
- **Deliverable**: `agent-specs/inventory-report.md` summarising findings.

- This ticket is part of a larger migration process 
- Assume required artifacts will be created if not already present.
- Note: Demo app has minimal code; focus on creating required migration artifacts.
