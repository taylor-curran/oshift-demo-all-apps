# CF to OpenShift Migration Demo Progress

## ðŸŽ­ Demo Simulation Approach

**For the Customer**: This demo simulates a **Cloud Foundry TAS â†’ Red Hat OpenShift** migration in a realistic way, but uses simplified technologies for demonstration purposes:

### **Production Reality**
- **Source**: Cloud Foundry TAS (Tanzu Application Service)
- **Target**: Red Hat OpenShift cluster
- **Scale**: Enterprise production workloads

### **Demo Environment** 
- **Source**: OSS Cloud Foundry via **Korifi on Kind** (simulates TAS behavior)
- **Target**: **Kind cluster + NGINX Ingress** (simulates OpenShift functionality)
- **Why**: Avoids licensing complexity while demonstrating identical migration patterns

**Key Point**: The migration logic, automation, and generated artifacts are **identical** to what you'd use in production. Only the underlying infrastructure is simplified for demo purposes.

## Demo Objective

Demonstrate automated migration of Java/Spring workloads from **Cloud Foundry** to **Red Hat OpenShift** using Windsurf AI-powered workflows that:

1. **Analyze** existing CF deployment manifests and service bindings
2. **Propose** OpenShift-native deployment strategies (Helm charts, operators, routes)
3. **Generate** compliant Kubernetes manifests following platform engineering standards
4. **Validate** generated resources against organizational policies and best practices

**Target Audience**: Platform engineering decision-makers evaluating automated migration tooling for TAS-to-OCP initiatives.
